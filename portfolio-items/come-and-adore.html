	<strong>Lyrics:</strong>
<p>
Angels filled the skies announcing his coming</br>
Shepherds rushed to worship the new-born king</br>
Wise men traced the star to their promised saviour</br>
Gather round, he is here
</p>

<p>
Could this be the king whose reign is eternal?</br>
Would the Lord of all choose so meek a birth?</br>
Has he come to save the world we have broken,</br>
Set us free from the curse?
</p>

<p><em>
Come and adore, come and worship</br>
Come and adore, come and worship</br>
Come and adore, come and worship</br>
Christ the King
</em></p>

<p>
Bear no more my soul the weight of your burdens</br>
Lay them at the feet of the prince of peace</br>
Come behold your life, your light, your salvation</br>
What is left now to fear?
</p>

<p><em>
Come and adore, come and worship</br>
Come and adore, come and worship</br>
Come and adore, come and worship</br>
Christ the King
</em></p>

<p>
Watch him as he grows proclaiming Godâ€™s favour</br>
Hear the shepherd care for his wounded flock</br>
See him lay side all glory and splendour</br>
Touch the sick, love the lost
</p>

<p>
Will you turn your back when their hearts cry traitor</br>
Join the mocking crowd as he bears your sin</br>
Disregard his life as some passing failure</br>
Or bow down to your king?
</p>

<p><em>
Come and adore, come and worship</br>
Come and adore, come and worship</br>
Come and adore, come and worship</br>
Christ the King
</em></p>
