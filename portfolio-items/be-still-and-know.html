	  <strong>Lyrics:</strong>
	<div>  
The Lord our God</br>
Held the waters in the hollow of his hand</br>
Weighed the mountains and the hills, </br>
There is no moon, no star</br>
No source of joy, no scar</br>
That lies beyond </br>
The Father's care and compassion</br>
</br>
Our God has seen</br>
The beginning and the end, all in between</br>
Every option at each junction of our history</br>
No new discovery,</br>
No scheme of man</br>
Can force his hand or surprise him</br>
</br>
<em>Be still and know the Lord your God</br>
Be still and know the Lord your God</br>
He will fulfil all he has planned</br>
Nothing escapes from his command</br>
Be still and know the Lord your God</em></br>
 </br>
God set us free</br>
Fully known and fully loved to live for him</br>
When our consciences condemn us, we will stand and sing</br>
My God knew all my sin</br>
When his own son</br>
Laid down his life for my ransom</br>
</br>
<em>Be still and know the Lord your God</br>
Be still and know the Lord your God</br>
He will fulfil all he has planned</br>
Nothing escapes from his command</br>
Be still and know the Lord your God</em></br>
</br>
As we hold fast </br>
To the God who has revealed himself to us</br>
We resolve with all our hearts to trust in him alone</br>
Surrender our unknowns</br>
And fix our eyes on his unfathomable splendour</br>
</br>
<em>Be still and know the Lord your God</br>
Be still and know the Lord your God</br>
He will fulfil all he has planned</br>
Nothing escapes from his command</br>
Be still and know the Lord your God</br>
</br>
He will fulfil all he has planned</br>
Nothing escapes from his command</br>
Be still and know the Lord your God</em></br>
