	<strong>Lyrics:</strong>
	<div>
	We sing Good news</br>
	Of great joy</br>
	To all people, to all nations</br>
	Evermore</br>
	A Saviour has been born to us</br>
	He is Christ Jesus,</br>
	He is the Lord!</br>
	</br>
	We sing Good news</br>
	Of great joy</br>
	To all people, to all nations</br>
	Evermore</br>
	A Saviour has been born to us</br>
	He is Christ Jesus,</br>
	He is the Lord!</br>
	</br>
	While we were his enemies</br>
	Jesus died for us</br>
	Reconciling wand'ring hearts</br>
	To the God of Love</br>
	He will grant Eternal Life</br>
	To all who trust in Him</br>
	In this truth united we will sing...</br>
	</br>
	We wish you a merry Christmas,</br>
	We wish you a merry Christmas,</br>
	We wish you a merry Christmas </br>
	And a happy new year!</br>
	</br>
    We wish you a merry Christmas,</br>
	We wish you a merry Christmas,</br>
	We wish you a merry Christmas </br>
	And a happy new year!	</br>
