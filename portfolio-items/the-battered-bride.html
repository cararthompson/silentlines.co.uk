	<strong>Lyrics:</strong>
	
	<p>TW: DA/DV</p>
	
	<p>The battered bride-to-be is longing<br />
For her true lover to return<br />
A tug of war reduced her gown to heaps of shreds<br />
Revealing bruises, broken bones and wounds that burn</p>

<p>Widows and orphans walk on hungry<br />
To spare the burden of their pleas<br />
Her hands are tied by quarrels raging deep within<br />
That drive her aching conscience to her to her bleeding knees</p>

<p>And she cries “Come, Holy Spirit, come,<br />
Come, Holy Spirit come”<br />
She cries “Come, Holy Spirit, come,<br />
Come, Holy Spirit, come”</p>
 
<p>Can she fulfil the great commission<br />
With shattered bones in both her feet?<br />
Yet her desire to share the lover of her soul<br />
Is burning stronger in her heart with every beat</p>

<p>And she cries “Come, Holy Spirit, come,<br />
Come, Holy Spirit come”<br />
Yes she cries “Come, Holy Spirit, come,<br />
Come, Holy Spirit, come”</p>

<p>Will we, the members of her body,<br />
Pound on that heart till it grows numb<br />
Or put to death our petty madness in one voice<br />
As we cry out “How long O Lord? O Spirit, come”?</p>

<p>May we cry “Come, Holy Spirit, come,<br />
Come, Holy Spirit come”<br />
We cry “Come, Holy Spirit, come,<br />
Come, Holy Spirit, come”</p>

<p>Yes we cry “Come, Holy Spirit, come,<br />
Come, Holy Spirit come”<br />
We cry “Come, Holy Spirit, come,<br />
Come, Holy Spirit, come”</p>
      </ul>
