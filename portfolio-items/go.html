<strong>Lyrics:</strong>
	<div>  
Made for your glory</br>
We sought our own</br>
With pride deciding what we’d do</br>
In love and mercy</br>
You left your throne</br>
And died to bring us back to you</br>
Freed from darkness we’re now running for the light</br>
Upholding what we’ve come to know is true</br>
</br>
Heirs of your kingdom</br>
We’re called to serve,</br>
Deny ourselves and follow you</br>
In this new freedom</br>
We don’t deserve</br>
May you be seen in all we do</br>
Keep us faithful, your word dwelling in our hearts</br>
That we may live a life that pleases you</br>
</br>
<em>We will go</br>
With your message of salvation</br>
We will go</br>
Spread the one hope for this nation</br>
We will go</br>
Shining in this generation </br>
Holding out the word of life</br></em>
</br>
In this new mission,</br>
Spirit and Word</br>
Are the two weapons we receive</br>
Give us compassion</br>
For those who’ve heard</br>
But live refusing to believe</br>
Grant them wisdom, Lord, please open up their eyes</br>
That they may see the hope you called them to</br>
<br/>
<strong>Men:</strong> Live for God, Speak for Christ (repeat)</br>
<strong>Women:</strong> How can they call one the one that they have not believed in?</br>
How can they believe if they have never heard?</br>
How can they hear if there is no one out there preaching?</br>
If we don’t live God, speak for Christ each day?</br>
</br>
<em>We will go</br>
With your message of salvation</br>
We will go</br>
Spread the one hope for this nation</br>
We will go</br>
Shining in this generation </br>
Holding out the word of life</br></em>
<br/>
<em>We will go</br>
With your message of salvation</br>
We will go</br>
Spread the one hope for this nation</br>
We will go</br>
Shining in this generation </br>
Holding out the word of life</br></em>
