Dad's going to be a magician</br>
Well, I think that was what he said</br>
Mind you, I was only four at the time</br>
So words may have got slightly confused in my head</br>
</br>
He's going to stop being a teacher</br>
And mum will help drive this new quest</br>
They clearly have talents for quite a few things</br>
But dad's magic tricks are not the best</br>
</br>
</br>
There was something about this guy Peter</br>
Who Jesus called out of his boat</br>
Mum and dad read about it around the same time</br>
And decided that they should take note</br>
</br>
So they taught us about this man called Abraham</br>
Who walked with no clue as to where he would go</br>
They said we should trust God knew what he was doing</br>
If we say he knows best, then why would we say no?</br>
</br>
</br>
So we got in a boat after packing a lorry</br>
And arrived in a big house with fields all around</br>
Our bedroom was massive, so we had fun racing our beds</br>
Across the still uncarpetted ground</br>
</br>
The church that we went to looked different to this,</br>
And they all spoke in some weird tongue</br>
But I know when they prayed God could still understand</br>
Maybe he also moved abroad when he was young</br>
</br>
</br>
Dad wrote more songs and mum kept the show running</br>
We learnt a new language, made friends, and we thrived</br>
The school days were long but the teachers were kind</br>
And they looked out for us from the day we arrived.</br>
</br>
When we all went on tour we met all sorts of people</br>
Who opened their homes in the towns where we stayed</br>
We met dancers who hugged us the first time they met us</br>
And put lipstick on while they prayed</br>
</br>
</br>
Because of this we grew up reciting scripture,</br>
Well we may possibly have been taking the mick</br>
Out of that lovely but strong southern accent</br>
And the ever so noticeable lisp</br>
</br>
- Or, Barabas était un bandit - </br>
</br>
That was silly, but I’m really grateful</br>
For those hours we spent hearing what Jesus said</br>
It's amazing how useful that turned out to be</br>
When those words just pop into your head</br>
</br>
</br>
Through the highs and lows of family holidays</br>
Craponne and Mahoina combined </br>
The book that got dad in complete fits of giggles</br>
And mum's yawning fits remain stuck in my mind</br>
</br>
It's true, things have not always been easy</br>
There've been challenges and fights to choose</br>
But the training in thinking through things for ourselves</br>
Is something we will forever use </br>
</br>
</br>
So as friends and family we're here today</br>
To celebrate with the One who planned it all</br>
We're gathered round two faithful servants</br>
Who decided to follow His call</br>
</br>
And where does that decision leave us</br>
25 years down the line?</br>
Well, I’m yet to see a fancy magic trick</br>
But I'd say we've all turned out just fine!</br>
