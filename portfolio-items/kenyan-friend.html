      <h3>Ode to a valiant friend</h3>
      <p>
		<em>An apology for dragging poor Robert up a foggy hill</em>
      </p>
	<div>  
We took our brand new Kenyan friend </br>
On a hike inside a cloud</br>
We climbed up a ben and got to the cairn</br>
And decided that he’d done us proud</br>
</br>
So we stopped for a picnic at what would have been</br>
A perfect wee spot for a beautiful view</br>
But the elements had somewhat conspired against us</br>
And an expanse of mist was the best we could do</br>
</br>
Bravely, he sat there, eating his sandwich</br>
Deciding that we must be mad</br>
At the words “let’s head home” his by now frozen face</br>
Could not show how much his heart was glad</br>
</br>
Down we went, back to the car park</br>
Accompanied by wind and rain</br>
Promising warm showers, haggis and hot chocolate</br>
To take his mind off all the pain</br>
</br>
“We made it” we cried as we got to the car</br>
And drove home for much longed-for showers</br>
He then collapsed in bed and has not emerged yet</br>
We should wake him up in a few hours</br>
</br>
Robert, dear friend, do not hold this against us</br>
We hoped that you’d end up enjoying this feat</br>
Your stone on the cairn proves you made it up there</br>
This is a not an adventure you need to repeat!</br>
