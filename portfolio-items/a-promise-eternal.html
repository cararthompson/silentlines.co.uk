		<strong>Lyrics:</strong>	 
        <div>		
Each morning we wake with a hope, a promise eternal</br>
Revealed by our God and secured by his own Son's blood</br>
His Spirit in us testifies we belong to our Saviour</br>
As we live and grow in the light of the Father's love</br>
</br>
Our hope and our rest is the work of Jesus, our Saviour</br>
Who rescued us out of all darkness into his light</br>
He laid down his life so that we may know God as our Father</br>
And rose again vanquishing death and granting us life</br>
</br>
<em>Devoted to good in our words and deeds</br>
We proclaim God’s favour</br>
Transformed by the truth</br>
That sets us free from all fear</br>
With lives purified, we adorn the gospel of God our Saviour</br>
Awaiting that glorious day when he will appear</em></br>
</br>
The work he began he will surely bring to completion</br>
Renewing our hearts, making pure what once was defiled</br>
Our Holy redeemer whose power sustains all creation</br>
Turns chaos to order in every sphere of our lives</br>
</br>
<em>Devoted to good in our words and deeds</br>
We proclaim God’s favour</br>
Transformed by the truth</br>
That sets us free from all fear</br>
With lives purified, we adorn the gospel of God our saviour</br>
Awaiting that glorious day when he will appear</em></br>
</br>
This hope we received must live on through each generation</br>
We’ll faithfully share all the truth entrusted to us</br>
Our hearts and our minds full of joy will sing out your salvation</br>
As godliness flows from God whose gospel we trust</br>
</br>
<em>Devoted to good in our words and deeds</br>
We proclaim God’s favour</br>
Transformed by the truth</br>
That sets us free from all fear</br>
With lives purified, we adorn the gospel of God our saviour</br>
Awaiting that glorious day when he will appear</em></br>
