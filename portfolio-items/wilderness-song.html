	  	<strong>Lyrics:</strong>
	<div>  
As I walk this arid land afraid of each tomorrow<br/>
Numbing silence grows within my soul<br/>
Must I watch each new oasis crumble into dust<br/>
Wondering why I second guess the God I trust?<br/>
Dare I not move on before I see around the corner?<br/>
When did child-like faith begin to fade?<br/>
<br/>
In the watches of the night I can but cling to Jesus<br/>
Will I learn to thirst for him alone?<br/>
In the shadow of his wing is joy I used to know<br/>
Have I settled for the treasures here below?<br/>
Meditate on him, my soul, and cleave to him, my reason<br/>
When did his provision ever fail?<br/>
<br/>
<em>I will run to my God and Father<br/>
Give him praise for all he’s done<br/>
Brave the tears and deafening thunder<br/>
In the steps of his Son<br/>
I will sing of the grace and mercy<br/>
That pursued my grumbling heart<br/>
Though his perfect ways escape me<br/>
With each trial I’ll cry, “How great thou art!”<br/></em>
<br/>
Author of the peace that lies beyond all understanding<br/>
Founder and perfecter of my faith<br/>
Living water, bread of life, you know my humble frame<br/>
Help my heart believe the truths that I proclaim<br/>
Longing for the day I’ll gaze in awe upon your glory<br/>
Sanctified by love that knows no end<br/>
<br/>
<em>I will run to my God and Father<br/>
Give him praise for all he’s done<br/>
Brave the tears and deafening thunder<br/>
In the steps of his Son<br/>
I will sing of the grace and mercy<br/>
That pursued my grumbling heart<br/>
Though his perfect ways escape me<br/>
With each trial I’ll cry, “How great thou art!”<br/></em>
