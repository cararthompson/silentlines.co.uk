          <strong>A few extracts:</strong>
        <div>		
		<i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
        May the beauty of thy holiness flood our souls, washing away all that is sordid, so that in whatever work our hands shall
		find this day to do we may show forth something of thy creative power, to thy glory. Amen.</div>
		<div class='spacing'></div>
		<div>
		<i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
		God grant we be not of those who narrow the divine goodness down to the channels of their own pet orthodoxy.</div>

		One of the biggest difficulties in worship, especially when it occupies so short a space of time as these services, 
		arises out of wandering thoughts. We are often warned against them and advised to drive them sternly away. 
		I would rather suggest that at the outset of worship, in the silence that precedes it, they should be given 
		a definite, <em>ungrudging</em> place; that whatever is at the moment of going to worship the dominant interest 
		of our conscious mind should be accepted, and that we should, as the first step towards worship, seek out the 
		connection between that activity or thought and God. For God is concerned with our life; there is nothing we cannot 
		link with Him by whom the very hairs of our head are numbered. <br/>
		For example: is the thought uppermost in my mind the 
		joyful anticipation of meeting a friend? I can readily bring that to Him in whom all friendships are enriched, and 
		go on my way knowing that our meeting will be enhanced by His participating Presence. Is it pleasurable satisfaction 
		in some success, in some game well played? God is the Lord of all good life, and rejoices in the activity and 
		well-being of His creatures. Or is it the sense of failure, burden, monotony, discouragement, shame? He is the 
		lifter-up of our head; He can put a well of music in our soul; He offers us to share His yoke and plough through 
		the day beside Him. In this way out of what might have been hindrances we build our daily altars of praise.</div>
