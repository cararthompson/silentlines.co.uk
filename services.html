    title: Song writing
    desc:
      Several of my songs have been commissions for a Bible teaching series or a conference. I enjoy the challenge of capturing the main themes of a book in a song. If that's something you or your church would be interested in, get in touch!
  - icon_class: fa fa-music
    title: Arranging
    desc:
      I emerged from my music degree knowing that I never wanted to give up orchestration. Cracking the puzzle of how to get a particular group of instruments to play something together that sounds good, taking into account the skills within the group, is one of life's great epic wins. 
      If you have a special service coming up and/or want to include people who play melodic instruments in the band for an event, I'd love to help write some scores for them.

    title: Research and data viz
    desc:
      I know, not what you'd expect alongside these other services, but if you're looking to collect data and present a summary of it, I may be able to help there too. It's all about presenting what can be complex information in a simple story. Plus, I love a good graph!
